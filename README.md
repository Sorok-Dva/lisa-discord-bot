# LISA (personnal discord-bot)

This is my own personnal discord bot, responding to my own needs and this bot name's Lisa !

Some commands are scraper that I made and that you can find on my github like [Freenom](https://github.com/Sorok-Dva/freenom-auto-renew-domains) or [CoinMarketCap](https://github.com/Sorok-Dva/coinmarketcap-scraper).

Some others commands are just specific to me, for example the ["Credit Mutuel"](https://www.creditmutuel.fr/)

## Can I use it ?

**Yes !**, but the repository isn't configured to be ready to go. Lot of data / files are really sensitive due to some targets (e.g: cr√©dit mutuel)
If you want to get some commands, especially **CM** you will need to create a `data` folder and create a cookie file with the real cookies of the website.

Anyway, you can take a look to the code, make a fork and update/change it as you want/need !


## I never faced to discord bot, how I can launch my own bot ?
 
You can find great videos guides on youtube or follow written guides ([How to build a discord bot on digital-ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js)), that i receommend you.
